// the task
    //Given an array X = [1,4,2,12], write a program that will iterate through the array and print
    //all numbers on the screen.
    //Your program should work with arrays of all sizes.

//Pseudocode
    //1-for loop to print  elements of an array
    //2-print the element

//code
var x = [1,4,2,12];
for(var i = 0; i < x.length;i++){

    console.log(x[i]);
}

//diagram
    //1-loop start with index number 0
    //2-print the index 0
    //3-loop goes again and bring index number 1
    //4-print index 1
    //5-.........
    //6-when the i becomes > than the x length the loop will stop
